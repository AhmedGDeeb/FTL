### Day 1: Welcome & Python Intro (Sep 14, 2026)

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Welcome & Program Overview:** The session introduced the FTL Syria Programme, its mission to apply frontier technologies like AI to climate challenges, and its structure over the next three months.
- **Program Logistics:** We learned about the timeline, the 70% minimum attendance requirement, access to a Coursera license, and the importance of the final Capstone project.
- **Python Bootcamp Launch:** The Python bootcamp will consist of eight sessions over two weeks, designed to build a foundation for the more advanced machine learning modules.
- **Tools Introduction:** The primary tools for the program are **Google Colab** for coding and **GitHub** for version control and sharing projects.
- **Python Fundamentals:** We kicked off the technical part by learning the absolute basics of Python:
    - **Variables:** Names that refer to objects in memory.
    - **Data Types:** Introduction to `int`, `float`, `string`, `list`, `dict`, and `boolean`.
    - **Dynamic Typing:** Python automatically determines the type of a variable at runtime.
    - **Expressions and Operators:** Combining values and variables with arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and assignment (`=`) operators.

### Day 2: Session 1 — Functions, Lambda & Control Flow (Sep 15, 2026)

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Review of Day 1:** We quickly recapped variables, data types, and basic operators.
- **Control Flow:** The main topic was controlling the flow of a program.
    - **Conditional Statements:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code based on certain conditions.
    - **Comparison Operators:** Using `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` to compare values.
    - **Logical Operators:** Using `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine multiple conditions.
- **Functions — Basics:**
    - **Definition:** A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
    - **Syntax:** Defined using `def function_name(parameters):` followed by an indented block.
    - **Return Values:** Functions can return values using the `return` keyword; if no `return` is used, the function returns `None`.
    - **Parameters vs. Arguments:** Parameters are the placeholders in the function definition; arguments are the actual values passed when calling the function.
    - **Scope:** Variables defined inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside it.
- **Lambda Functions:**
    - **Definition:** A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword.
    - **Syntax:** `lambda arguments: expression`
    - **When to Use:** Best for short, one-line operations where a full `def` function would be overkill.
    - **Example:** `square = lambda x: x ** 2`
    - **Common Use Cases:** Passing a function as an argument (e.g., to `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`), inline calculations.
- **Practice:** We wrote small functions and lambda expressions to solve simple problems (e.g., unit conversions, basic calculations).

### Day 3: Session 2 — Strings & Files (Sep 16, 2026)

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Exercise Review & Peer Feedback:** We reviewed our previous exercise (the BMI calculator and treasure-hunt game). I presented my **function-oriented BMI calculator** (with unit conversions, health categories, and CLI interaction) and a **randomly generated treasure-and-trap grid game** (with boundary checks and user attempts). The facilitator asked me to share my solution with the group for peer review and comments. The key lesson: combine the best elements from different approaches.

- **Python Strings — Representation & Core Operations:**
    - **Definition:** A string is a **sequence of characters** enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.
    - **No Separate Character Type:** In Python, there is no `char` type — a single character is just a string of length 1.
    - **Immutability:** Strings cannot be changed in place; operations create new strings. Demonstrated with `id()` — the memory address changes after concatenation.
    - **Indexing:** Each character has an index starting from `0` (zero-based); negative indices count from the end (`-1` = last character).
    - **Concatenation:** Combine strings with `+`.
    - **Repetition:** Repeat strings with `*`.
    - **Length:** Use `len()` to count characters.

- **String Indexing & Slicing:**
    - **Indexing:** Access individual characters with `string[index]`.
    - **Slicing:** Extract a range with `string[start:stop:step]`. The **stop index is exclusive** (not included). Defaults: start=`0`, stop=end, step=`1`.
    - **Negative Indexing:** Access from the end (`-1` = last character).
    - **Example:** `"Monty Python"[0:4]` returns `"Mont"`; `"frontier"[0:4]` returns `"fron"`.

- **String Methods & Object Inspection:**
    - **Common Methods:** `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.find()`, `.startswith()`, `.endswith()`, `.join()`.
    - **`dir()`:** Lists all available methods for an object — a great way to explore (e.g., `dir('Lamacun')`).
    - **`type()`:** Confirms the data type (e.g., `type(s)` returns `str`).
    - **Parsing Example:** Extracting the username from an email using `.find("@")` and slicing: `email[0:findex]` returns `"john.doe"`.

- **String Comparisons & Boolean Checks:**
    - **Equality:** `==` and `!=` compare strings (e.g., `'Helo' == 'Hello'` returns `False`).
    - **Prefix/Suffix:** `.startswith()` and `.endswith()` return `True`/`False`.
    - **Use Case:** Filtering or validating text data.

- **Loop-Based Vowel Counting:**
    - **Approach:** Normalize to lowercase, iterate through each character, increment a counter when a vowel is found.
    - **Two Implementations:** One with a `while` loop (`count_vowels_while`), one with a `for` loop (`count_vowels_for`) — same logic, different syntax.

- **Type Annotations (Optional but Good Practice):**
    - Python is **dynamically typed**, so annotations are not required.
    - **Why Use Them:** Document expected types, support error handling, improve readability.
    - **Example:** `def count_vowels(text: str) -> int:`

- **Palindrome Exercise:**
    - **Definition:** A word, phrase, or number that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
    - **Approach:** Clean the input with `''.join(c for c in input_string if c.isalnum()).lower()`, then use `left` and `right` indices to compare characters from opposite ends, moving inward.
    - **Two Versions:** One using a `while` loop (`is_palindrome_while`), one using a `for` loop (`is_palindrome_for`).
    - **Example:** `"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"` is a palindrome.

- **Python File Concepts & Opening Files:**
    - **Why Files Matter:** Data comes from different sources — we need to read, write, and append. Console input uses primary memory (RAM); files use secondary memory.
    - **Built-in `open()` Function:** `open(filepath, mode)` returns a **file handle** (`_io.TextIOWrapper`) providing methods to interact with the file.
    - **File Modes:**
        - `"r"` — Read (default)
        - `"w"` — Write (creates file, **replaces** existing content)
        - `"a"` — Append (adds to the end, **preserves** existing content)
        - `"b"` — Binary mode (for images, executables)
    - **Colab Note:** Mount Google Drive with `from google.colab import drive; drive.mount('/content/drive')` to access files.

- **Reading Files:**
    - **`.read()`** — Reads the entire file as a single string.
    - **`.readline()`** — Reads one line (the first line).
    - **`.readlines()`** — Reads all lines into a list.
    - **Looping:** Use a `for` loop with `enumerate()` to read specific lines or process line-by-line with numbering.

- **Writing & Appending Files:**
    - **Write Mode (`"w"`):** Replaces existing content; creates a new empty file if it doesn't exist.
    - **Append Mode (`"a"`):** Adds new content at the end without erasing; creates a new file if it doesn't exist.
    - **Best Practice:** Use the `with` statement — it automatically closes the file when the block completes, so no explicit `.close()` is needed.

- **Listing Files in a Directory:**
    - Use `os.listdir(basepath)` to iterate over every item (files, directories).
    - Use `os.path.isfile(os.path.join(basepath, entry))` to check if a path points to a regular file.

- **Error Handling for File Operations:**
    - **Problem:** `FileNotFoundError` when the path or filename is incorrect.
    - **Solution:** Use `try`/`except` to catch errors and provide a helpful message.
    - **Example:**
      ```python
      try:
          fhand = open(filept, "r")
          content = fhand.read()
          print(content)
      except:
          print('File Not found check again: ', filept)
          quit()
      ```

### Day 4: Session 3 — Data Structures (Sep 17, 2026)

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Data Structures Overview:**
    - A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data so it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
    - Classified into **Linear** (lists, tuples) and **Non-linear** (dictionaries).

- **Python Lists:**
    - **Definition:** Ordered collections that can contain mixed data types. They are similar to arrays in other languages but with more capabilities.
    - **Properties:**
        - **Ordered:** Maintain the order of data insertion (e.g., `ordered_list[0]` returns the first item).
        - **Changeable (Mutable):** Items can be modified after creation (e.g., `ordered_list[0] = 'mango'`).
        - **Heterogeneous:** Can contain data of different types (e.g., `['apple', 100, 3.14, True, ['sub-list', 'elements']]`).
        - **Allows Duplicates:** Duplicate data is permitted (e.g., `['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana']`).

- **List Methods:**
    - **`.append(item)`** — Adds a single item to the end of the list. If the item is a list, it is added as a nested list.
    - **`.extend(iterable)`** — Adds multiple items from an iterable to the end, flattening them into the list.
    - **`.sort(reverse=True/False)`** — Sorts the list in place. `reverse=True` sorts in descending order.
    - **`len(list)`** — Returns the number of items in the list.

- **List Operations:**
    - **`+` (Concatenation):** Combines two lists into a new list (e.g., `[1, 3, 3] + [4, 4, 6]` = `[1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6]`).
    - **`*` (Repetition):** Repeats a list a given number of times (e.g., `[1, 3, 3] * 3` = `[1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3]`).

- **List Slicing:**
    - Format: `list[start:end]` — starts at `start` and goes up to, but does **not** include, `end`.
    - **Negative Slicing:** `numbers[-3:]` returns the last three items.
    - **Example:** `numbers[2:4]` on `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `[2, 3]`.

- **Accessing List Elements:**
    - Items are identified by their position, starting with `0`.
    - **Negative Indexing:** `dogs[-1]` returns the last element; `dogs[-2]` returns the second-to-last.

- **Lists and Loops:**
    - **`for` Loop:** Iterates over each item in the list (e.g., `for dish in dishes: print('I love ' + dish + ' very much')`).
    - **`enumerate()`:** Tracks the index of each item during iteration (e.g., `for index, dish in enumerate(dishes): print('Dish Number: ' + str(index) + ' ' + dish)`).

- **Lists and Strings:**
    - **`.split()`** — Breaks a string into a list of words (e.g., `"Python for Everybody".split()` returns `['Python', 'for', 'Everybody']`).
    - **`.join()`** — Combines a list into a string (e.g., `' '.join(words)` returns `"Python for Everybody"`).

- **Dictionaries:**
    - **Definition:** Store data values in **key:value** pairs. General syntax: `{key_1: value_1, key_2: value_2}`.
    - **Characteristics:**
        - **Keys are unique** — no duplicates allowed.
        - **No index** — not ordered by position; the key is the default iterator used to retrieve values.
        - **Mutable (changeable)** — values can be modified (e.g., `fruits_dict['apple'] = 4`).
        - Accessing a non-existent key raises a **`KeyError`** (e.g., `fruits_dict[0]`).

- **Dictionary Methods:**
    - **`.keys()`** — Returns all keys (e.g., `dict_keys(['apple', 'oranges', 'mangos'])`).
    - **`.values()`** — Returns all values (e.g., `dict_values([4, 2, 3])`).
    - **`.items()`** — Returns all key:value pairs as tuples (e.g., `dict_items([('apple', 4), ('oranges', 2), ('mangos', 3)])`).

- **Common Dictionary Operations:**
    - **Adding new key-value pairs:** `african_countries['Nigeria'] = 'Abuja'`.
    - **Modifying values:** `african_countries['Cameroon'] = 'Yaounde'`.
    - **Removing key-value pairs:** `del african_countries['Cameroon']`.
    - **Modifying keys:** Two steps — create a new key with the old value, then delete the old key (e.g., `african_countries['Niger'] = african_countries['Nigeria']; del african_countries['Nigeria']`).

- **Dictionaries and Loops:**
    - **Loop through all key-value pairs:** `for country, capital in african_countries.items():`.
    - **Loop through all keys:** `for key in my_dict.keys():` (or simply `for key in my_dict:`).
    - **Loop through all values:** `for value in my_dict.values():`.

- **Tuples:**
    - **Definition:** Ordered, **immutable** collections — like lists that can never be changed after creation. Can contain mixed data types.
    - **Creating Tuples:** `sample_tuple = (1, 2, "Python", 3.5)`; convert from a list with `tuple(['Veery', 'Eastern Meadowlark', 10, 25, True])`; blank tuple with `tuple()`.
    - **Accessing Elements:** Same indexing as lists (e.g., `c_tup[2]` returns `'South Africa'`).
    - **Slicing:** Same syntax as lists (e.g., `c_tup[1:4]` returns `('Egypt', 'South Africa', 'Ghana')`).
    - **Converting between Lists and Tuples:** `tuple(sample_list)` and `list(converted_tuple)`.
    - **Tuples as Return Values:** Functions can return multiple values as a tuple (e.g., `def min_max(numbers): return (min(numbers), max(numbers))`).

- **Dictionaries and Tuples (Advanced):**
    - **Sorting by key:** `sorted(word_freq.items())`.
    - **Sorting by value:** `sorted(word_freq.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)` — uses a lambda to select the value for sorting.

- **Assignments:**
    - **List Assignment (Party):** Maintain a guest list using Python lists — add guests, remove guests, and check who's on the list.
    - **Advanced Party Guest Manager:** Build a guest management system using dictionaries and tuples:
        1. Initialize an empty `guests` dictionary where each guest has a name, age, and email.
        2. Add guests using tuples: `"Alice", 28, "alice@email.com"`, `"Bob", 35, "bob@email.com"`, `"Charlie", 30, "charlie@email.com"`. Use the name as the key and `(age, email)` as the value.
        3. Update the list: add `"David", 22, "david@email.com"` and remove `"Bob"`.
        4. Create `get_guest_info(guest_name)` — returns a formatted string if the guest is on the list, otherwise a "not on the guest list" message.
        5. Display the total number of guests.
        - **Extensions:** Allow user input for new guests, display guests in order of age, and handle duplicate guest names by prompting to update or skip.

### Day 5: Session 4 — Working with Scientific Data in Python / Intro to OOP (Sep 21, 2026)

**Key Takeaways**
1. Course Plan & Capstone Projects
    - The week includes: continued Python material, a coding session, a ninth session, and a **Wednesday coding challenge**.
    - **Capstone projects**: Participants can choose their own topics. The instructor will provide optional problem suggestions and guidelines for documenting the problem and proposed solution.
    - Submission options:
    - **No GitHub**: Submit a Python notebook or script via email.
    - **With GitHub**: Upload work and send the link to the instructor.

2. Review of Lists, Loops, Dictionaries, Strings & Tuples
    - **Lists + Loops**: `for` loops iterate over each item in a list.
    - **`enumerate()`**: Exposes the index of each item during iteration.
    - **String ↔ List conversion**:
    - `.split()` — breaks a string into a list of words
    - `.join()` — combines a list into a string
    - **Dictionaries**: Key-value collections with unique keys; demonstrated reading, changing, adding, and removing entries.
    - **Looping through dictionaries**: Process keys, values, or complete key-value pairs.
    - **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections; demonstrated creation, conversion from lists, indexing, slicing, and use for preserving unchangeable values.

3. Guest-List Application Demonstration (Abdulrahman Abdulkader)
    - Presented a guest-list app that:
    - Separated data operations from command-line display and control logic
    - Handled empty lists and errors gracefully
    - Used a **dictionary to map menu choices to functions**
    - **Function references**: George Al Issa asked how the dictionary referenced functions. Abdulrahman explained that functions are objects whose references can be stored and later invoked through dictionary keys.

4. Transition to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - OOP helps organize larger programs and prevents code repetition.
    - **Core terminology**:
    - **Class**: A template/blueprint defining attributes and behavior
    - **Attribute**: A variable within a class
    - **Method**: A function within a class
    - **Object**: A particular instance of a class
    - **Constructor**: Runs when an object is created
    - **Inheritance**: Extending a class to make a new class
    - **Encapsulation & Abstraction**: Deferred to later sessions

5. Python Objects & Built-In Classes
    - In Python, **everything is an object**.
    - Examples:
    - `type("a")` → `str` class
    - `type(2.2)` → `float` class
    - `type(5)` → `int` class
    - Lists belong to the `list` class
    - Built-in objects (strings, integers, floats, lists) expose methods defined by their classes.

6. Creating a Custom Dog Class
    - Started with an **empty class** using `pass` as a placeholder (Python doesn't allow empty class bodies).
    - Created an **instance** and checked its type.
    - Progressed from an empty class to one with attributes and methods.

7. Instance Attributes & Methods
    - **`__init__`**: Constructor method to initialize attributes when a new instance is created.
    - **`self`**: Represents the individual object/instance.
    - **Instance attributes**: Belong to each individual object (e.g., a dog's name and age).
    - **Methods**: Define behavior (e.g., eating, sleeping, barking).
    - Example: A dog's `tired` state controlled whether it would sleep or play.

8. Class Attributes & Inheritance
    - **Class attributes**: Defined outside the constructor; shared by all instances of the class (e.g., `species = "canine"`).
    - Useful for storing constants and values common to all instances.
    - **Inheritance**: Introduced as a future topic — allows a new class to reuse attributes and behaviors from an existing class.
    - **Encapsulation and abstraction**: Deferred.

9. Practice Exercises & Submission Process
    - Instructor shared **class exercises** for participants to complete independently.
    - Exercises will be reviewed at the beginning of the next session.
    - **Submission options** (clarified for Amjad Shekhani):
    - Email a Python notebook or script
    - Submit a GitHub link
    - Instructor planned to share materials earlier before future sessions.


### Day 6: Session 5 — OOP Continued, Regex & Web Scraping (Sep 22, 2026)

**Key Takeaways**

1. Exercise Distribution & Deadline
    - Three exercises were emailed to students.
    - **Deadline extended to Friday, 25 September 2026.**
    - Submission options:
    - Jupyter/Colab notebook (.ipynb)
    - Python script (.py)
    - GitHub repository
    - Upload to Google Drive/OneDrive and share the link
    - If a function is created, show the calling stage in the submission.

2. Evaluation & Peer-Coding
    - This exercise is part of **continuous evaluation** but is **not shown on the certificate** — it just confirms you pass and continue.
    - The **hackathon** is the biggest evaluation.
    - **Peer-coding** will come later (after the hackathon, likely during the data analysis weeks).
    - Order: individual exercise → hackathon → peer-coding.

3. Exercise Clarifications (from Amjad's questions)
    - **"List of dictionaries"**: A list containing dictionaries — one dictionary per city with keys `name`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `rainfall`.
    - Data can be self-created (simple) or from an API/external dataset (optional, not graded higher).
    - Functions are **optional** unless explicitly mentioned in the exercise.
    - The missing temperature value is **intentional** — to practice `continue`, count valid observations, and handle incomplete data.
    - "Valid observations" = cities with a temperature value present.
    - Temperature classification can be done with an `if` statement inside or outside a function — open to you.

---

**OOP Concepts Continued**

4. Inheritance
    - A new class (child/subclass) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent/base class).
    - Benefits: code reuse, extension of existing classes, hierarchy.
    - Example: `Dog` (parent) → `GoldenRetriever` (child) inherits name, age, tired state, and methods.
    - In Python, calling parent methods does **not** require `super` — child objects can call inherited methods directly.
    - (Contrast with Java, where `super.method()` is used.)

5. Encapsulation
    - Combining data (attributes) and methods inside a class, while **restricting direct access** to internal data.
    - Python convention: prefix with `_` or `__` for "private" attributes.
    - `__balance` (double underscore) is name-mangled — not directly accessible.
    - Access is controlled through **public methods** (e.g., `deposit()`, `check_balance()`).
    - **Example**: A bank balance — users must deposit through a method, not set the balance directly.
    - Similar to `private`/`public` in C++.

6. Abstraction
    - Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only what's necessary.
    - Uses the `abc` module (`ABC`, `abstractmethod`).
    - An **abstract base class** cannot be instantiated directly — a subclass must implement the abstract methods.
    - **Analogy**: Driving a car — you use the steering wheel, brake, and accelerator without knowing how the engine, fuel, or transmission work.

7. Polymorphism
    - Different classes can use the **same method name** but produce different behavior.
    - Example: `Animal` (parent) has `speak()`. `Dog.speak()` returns "wolf", `Cat.speak()` returns "meow".
    - Same method name, different outputs depending on the object's class.

---

**Regular Expressions (Regex)**

8. Introduction to Regex
    - A pattern (character or sequence) used to **match patterns in text**.
    - Python module: `re`.
    - Uses: data cleaning, formatting, extracting emails, phone numbers, URLs, etc.
    - Regex is case-sensitive by default (as far as the session clarified).

9. `re.search()`
    - Searches a string for a match and returns the **first match**.
    - Returns `None` if no match found.
    - Can be wrapped in an `if` statement to check if a pattern was found.
    - Can be applied row-by-row to CSV data using a loop.

10. `re.findall()`
    - Returns a **list of all matches** of the pattern in the string.
    - Useful for large datasets.
    - Example: Finding all words that start with "A" and end with "C".

11. Pattern Syntax Discussed

    | Symbol | Meaning |
    |---|---|
    | `^` | Start of line |
    | `$` | End of line |
    | `.` | Any character |
    | `\s` | Whitespace |
    | `\S` | Non-whitespace |
    | `*` | Zero or more repetitions of the preceding character |
    | `+` | One or more repetitions |
    | `?` | Zero or one repetition |
    | `[abc]` | Any of a, b, or c |
    | `[^abc]` | Not a, b, or c |
    | `[a-z]` | Range a to z |
    | `\d` | Any digit |
    | `\w` | Any alphanumeric character |
    | `\W` | Non-alphanumeric |

    - Patterns can be **combined**.
    - `*` means "zero or more of the character before it" — so `A*C` can match just "C".

**Web Scraping**
12. What is Web Scraping?
    - Extracting data from websites.
    - Fetch web page content and analyze/interpret it.

13. HTTP Methods (via `requests` library)
    | Method | Purpose |
    |---|---|
    | `GET` | Retrieve data from a server |
    | `POST` | Send/create new data on a server |
    | `PUT` | Update data on a server |
    | `DELETE` | Delete data from a server |

14. `requests` Library
    - Used to make HTTP requests.
    - Example: `requests.get(url)` retrieves web content.
    - Can use `dir()` to explore available methods.

15. Beautiful Soup
    - Library for pulling data out of HTML/XML.
    - Creates a parse tree to extract information.
    - Example: Extracting the page title.
    - Works alongside `requests`.

16. Data Formats & APIs
    - Web data usually comes as **JSON** or **XML**.
    - **API** = Application Programming Interface — allows applications to communicate and retrieve data over the internet.
    - APIs provide methods to collect data; detailed API instruction deferred to a later session.

17. Libraries Mentioned for Future Sessions
    - `pandas` — reading files, data frames
    - `os` — system operations
    - `requests` — HTTP requests
    - `BeautifulSoup` — HTML/XML parsing
    - `re` — regular expressions

### Day 7: Session 6 — Introduction to Databases, SQL & SQLite (Sep 23, 2026)

**Key Takeaways**

1.  **Final Introductory Python Session & Transition to Data Analysis**
    - This session concluded the introductory Python material.
    - Future sessions will still use Python but will focus on data-analysis techniques rather than programming fundamentals.
    - A short assignment is due by **Friday**.
    - **COSA licenses** will be distributed progressively from **Friday through Monday/Tuesday**. Participants will receive an email notification to log in or create an account.
    - Participants are encouraged to suggest additional courses that could be added.

2.  **Database Concepts & Data Models**
    - A **database** is a structured collection of data organized and stored systematically, typically in digital format. It is designed to store, retrieve, add, delete, and update data efficiently.
    - Benefits: efficiency, reliability, security, recovery, encryption, and backups.
    - A **data model** is the blueprint or design of a database. It defines how data is organized, stored, and how different pieces relate to each other (e.g., tables, columns, relationships, rules).
    - Databases solve the problem of storing, updating, and preserving data while avoiding duplication.

3.  **Relational Databases & SQL**
    - A **relational database** is a collection of one or more tables. Tables store data in rows (records) and columns (fields/attributes).
    - **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the language used to communicate with a relational database. It allows you to create, store, retrieve, update, and delete information.
    - Basic SQL Operations:
        - `SELECT`: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
        - `INSERT`: Add new records.
        - `UPDATE`: Change the content of existing records.
        - `DELETE`: Remove records or tables.
    - Filtering data is done using the `WHERE` clause.
    - Results can be ordered using `ORDER BY` (ascending or descending).

4.  **SQLite & SQLite Browser**
    - **SQLite** is a lightweight, serverless, zero-configuration relational database. It is ideal for embedded devices and small applications, and is easily compatible with Python.
    - **SQLite Browser** is a visual, open-source GUI tool used to create, design, edit, and manage SQLite database files. It allows you to run SQL queries, view results, and export data.
    - Participants can download SQLite tools from the official website, selecting the appropriate version for their operating system and processor architecture (e.g., Windows 32-bit or 64-bit).

5.  **Practical SQL Demonstration**
    - **Creating a Table:**
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE users (
            name VARCHAR(128),
            email VARCHAR(128)
        );
        ```
    - **Inserting Data:**
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John', 'john@example.com');
        ```
    - **Retrieving Data:**
        ```sql
        SELECT email FROM users WHERE name = 'John';
        ```
    - **Updating Data:**
        ```sql
        UPDATE users SET email = 'new@example.com' WHERE name = 'John';
        ```
    - **Deleting Data:**
        ```sql
        DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'John';
       ```
